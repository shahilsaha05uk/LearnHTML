        First of all, what does the word semantic mean? Well, definition of semantic is relating to meaning in language or logic. In other words, it has some inherent meaning, the names have some inherent meaning. Now when it applies to HTML, what does semantic html element mean? Well, a semantic html element is an element that implies some meaning to the content. In other words, it's an element that tells you something about the content, whether its importance, whether it's a little bit of its description, it basically hints to you to that meaning. Now the reason that's important is because us, humans, and machines can understand the meaning of that content surrounded by a semantic tag much better than if we just surround it with some tag that doesn't really tell us anything other than this is some sort of a division within the document. And also, it may help search engine rankings. In other words, SEO and SEO stands for search engine optimization. Now I stress may here because there is some controversy and disagreement among experts if this is really true. Now experts who disagree with this say that modern search engines are so sophisticated nowadays that just about nothing other than the content itself affects the ranking of the page. So you're welcome to go and Google for the words, do semantic HTML5 tags help SEO, and you could see a lot of discussion on this topic. Now let's take a look at an example of the first type of semantic tags that we're going to look at, the headings. Okay, so here, I'm in Sublime Text and I'm in the examples Lecture06 folder looking at the file called headings.html, and this is a very simple HTML document. It has all the h1 elements, h1, h2, h3 and all the way to the h6 element, well, basically, all the available heading elements. And what these headings are trying to convey is that the heading content between opening h1 and the closing h1 element is the most important heading in the document, and on, and on, and on. So h6 would be also a heading of the document, but it's the least important one of them all. So, let's take a look at what this document looks like in the browser,
